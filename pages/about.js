        <p>Sroove is excited to establish a community that fosters an environment of learning and growth. 
            This platform enables learners to enrol in courses to kickstart their interest at a low cost. 
            Opportunities are tough to come by, but having a community of like-minded individuals and 
            instructors that act as mentors can give one a head start. On this platform, instructors have a 
            ready pool of targeted students and can focus their time and effort on creating valuable content and accelerating learning for their students.
